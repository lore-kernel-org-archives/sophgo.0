Who knows, maybe someone will design a product which doesn't attach
a PCIe switch to the SoC, maybe the lack of peripherals isn't a
problem for them.

It seems reasonable to accommodate such non-switch use cases as well,
so I think you definitely do not want to quirk all products using that
SoC but only those that need it, regardless whether it's the majority.

Yes, somebody did a writeup how to represent switches and endpoints
in the devicetree:

https://farlepet.github.io/linux/2024/02/20/using-linux-device-tree-with-pcie-devices.html

And then I would try providing an empty "interrupts" property for
those switch ports for which you want to avoid port services being
instantiated.

That way you could selectively *enable* port services for specific
ports where it's useful.  Let's say you need DPC on a specific port
to contain errors of an attached NVMe drive.  Just assign a single
MSI for that port and assign no MSIs for all the others.  Much more
flexible than globally disabling port services.

Thanks,

Lukas
